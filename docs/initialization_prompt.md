I'm building a small app to help me analyze and optimize prompts for local LLMs (served via Ollama or LM Studio, or by using mlx_lm). I'm a developer with advanced Node.js skills and am working on my Python skills. The app can be run locally or on Docker.

I have two prompts: one for analysis and one for optimization, according to the analysis. I'm looking for scaffolding around these two prompts and a means to run them against text input, all within the app.

Before you write any code, please provide at least two options for implementation with a clear breakdown of the pros and cons of each approach. Consider these factors: ease of development, runtime performance on a 2023 Macbook M3, and potential for future expansion.

Specifically, I'm interested in options using Python 3 or Javascript (Vue/Nuxt/HTML + Javascript). I don't need a secure, scalable, enterprise-scale application â€“ just something that will run two prompts against text input and display the results.

If you have any questions that would help in your planning, please ask first.
